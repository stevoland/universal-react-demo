## About

Used this as an excuse to go through testing scenarios for Redux. I'm assuming the
[universal boilerplate][1] I'm using is covered with tests although it isn't.

Ran out of time to provide test coverage for the Repo view and the routing. Testing the routing
should be pretty straightforward - just shallow render the `Router`.
